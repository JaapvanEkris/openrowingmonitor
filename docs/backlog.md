# Development Roadmap for Open Rowing Monitor

This is currently is a very minimalistic Backlog for further development of this project.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## Soon

* Improve the user interface
* add possibility for user to define training interval timers (Server.js can already handle this, missing is the frontend to the web and PM5)
* add possibility for user to define workouts (i.e. training intervals with goals. Server.js can already handle this, missing is the frontend to the web and PM5)
* validate FTMS with more training applications and harden implementation (i.e. Holofit and Coxswain)

## Later

* figure out where to set the Service Advertising Data (FTMS.pdf p 15)
* add some attributes to BLE DeviceInformationService
* Integrate with rowsandall.com, intervals.icu and trainingpeaks for workout planning and reporting

## Ideas

* Add GUI indicators for training zones
