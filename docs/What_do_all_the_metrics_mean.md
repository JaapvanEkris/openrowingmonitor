# What do all these metrics mean?

Open Rowing Monitor can display or report many metrics:

* Distance rowed (meters) and Time rowed (in millisecond accuracy)
* Power (watts)
* Pace (/500m)
* Total number of strokes
* Heart Rate (requires an external Heartrate monitor)
* Strokes per Minute (SPM)
* Calories used (kcal)
* Drag factor,
* Drive length (meters),
* Drive time (milliseconds),
* Recovery Time (milliseconds),
* Average handle force (Newton),
* Peak handle force (Newton)
* VO2Max (tcx export only)
* Handle force curve (Newton, requires a RowsAndAll subscription to visualise),
* Handle velocity curve (meters per second, requires a RowsAndAll subscription to visualise),
* Handle power curve (Watts, requires a RowsAndAll subscription to visualise)

In this page, we explain what these metrics mean, and how to interpret them. As some metrics and an interpretation are a field of their own, we provide usefull links to understanding them.

## Distance and time rowed

## Power

## Pace

Pace is the speed for that stroke, which in rowing typically is described as the time required to row 500 meters. THe less time you need, the faster you are going.

## Total number of strokes

## Heart Rate

## Strokes per Minute

## Calories used

## Drag factor

THe drag factor is how much drag the flywheel is generating, which for air rowers typically can be set using a lever at the flywheel. This is NOT a resistance lever, where you excel when it it at its highest. It is more like a gear on a bike, where [the choice for the optimal drag factor is an individual choice](https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/tips-and-general-info/damper-setting-101). Please note: even [Olympic rowers evade rowing at high drag factors as it is injury prone](https://www.concept2.com/news/damper-and-drag-olympians)
