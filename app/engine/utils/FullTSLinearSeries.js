  The TSLinearSeries is a datatype that represents a Linear Series. It allows
  values to be retrieved (like a FiFo buffer, or Queue) but it also includes
  a Theil-Sen estimator Linear Regressor to determine the slope of this timeseries.

  At creation its length is determined. After it is filled, the oldest will be pushed
  out of the queue) automatically. This is a property of the Series object

  A key constraint is to prevent heavy calculations at the end (due to large
  array based curve fitting), which might happen on a Pi zero

  In order to prevent unneccessary calculations, this implementation uses lazy evaluation,
  so it will calculate the intercept and goodnessOfFit only when needed, as many uses only
  (first) need the slope.

  This implementation uses concepts that are described here:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator

  The array is ordered such that x[0] is the oldest, and x[x.length-1] is the youngest
