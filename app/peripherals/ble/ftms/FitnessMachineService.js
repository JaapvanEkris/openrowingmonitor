  Open Rowing Monitor, https://github.com/JaapvanEkris/openrowingmonitor

  Implements the Fitness Machine Service (FTMS) according to specs.
  Either presents a FTMS Rower (for rower applications that can use parameters such as Stroke Rate) or
  simulates a FTMS Indoor Bike (for usage with bike training apps)

  Relevant parts from https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/fitness-machine-service-1-0
  For Discovery we should implement:
  - Fitness Machine Feature Characteristic
  - Rower Data Characteristic
  - Training Status Characteristic (not yet implemented) todo: Maybe implement a simple version of it to see which
    applications make use of it. Might become interesting, if we implement training management
  - Fitness Machine Status Characteristic
  - Fitness Machine Control Point Characteristic
